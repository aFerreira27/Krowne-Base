## Recent Updates

- **AI-Powered Data Entry**: Implemented a new feature on the "New Product" page that allows users to upload a PDF specification sheet. A Genkit AI flow parses the document and automatically populates the form fields, including name, SKU, description, specifications, and relevant product tags.
- **Product Tagging System**: Added a comprehensive tagging system to the product schema. Users can now add, remove, and filter products by tags, improving organization and searchability.
- **UI Enhancements**: Added an "Add Product" button directly to the product listing page for quicker access. Updated product cards to display the product series and tags.
- **Firebase Deployment Error**: Resolved a deployment error: `Could not read source directory` during Firebase App Hosting deploy. This was caused by a dangling symlink named `result` in the project root, likely created by the Nix environment or during Cloud SQL Proxy setup. The fix was to manually remove it using `rm result`.
- **Favicon Conflict in Next.js**: Fixed an issue where the favicon wasn't displaying correctly. This was due to a conflicting file (likely `favicon.ico` or similar) in the `src/app` directory. Removing or renaming the file resolved the conflict with Next.js's automatic favicon handling.
- **Local Development Script**: Added a `start_local.sh` script that automates launching both the Cloud SQL Proxy and the Next.js development server, streamlining local development and testing.
- **Custom Domain** Added support for a custom domain (`krownebase.art`) on Firebase App Hosting.
- **Google Cloud SQL database** Switched from using local data files to fetching product data directly from the Google Cloud SQL database.
- **Firebase App Hosting** Updated Firebase configuration to use Firebase App Hosting for the Next.js backend.

## Technology Stack

The Krowne Product Hub is built with a modern, scalable, and type-safe technology stack designed for performance and maintainability.

-   **Framework**: **Next.js (App Router)** - A production-grade React framework providing server-side rendering (SSR), static site generation (SSG), and powerful routing capabilities.
-   **Language**: **TypeScript** - A typed superset of JavaScript that enhances code quality and developer experience by catching errors early.
-   **UI Library**: **React** - The core library for building dynamic and interactive user interfaces.

-   **Development Environment**: **Nix** - Used to ensure a consistent and reproducible development environment across different machines.
-   **UI Components**: **ShadCN UI** - A collection of beautifully designed, reusable, and accessible components built on top of Radix UI and Tailwind CSS.
-   **Icons**: **Lucide React** - A simply beautiful and consistent icon library.
-   **Database**: **PostgreSQL** - A powerful, open-source object-relational database system for storing all product data.
-   **Database Hosting**: **Google Cloud SQL** - A fully-managed database service from Google Cloud that hosts our PostgreSQL instance.
-   **Hosting**: **Firebase App Hosting** - A secure, fast, and scalable hosting solution optimized for Next.js applications, handling server-side rendering, static assets, and backend functions seamlessly.
