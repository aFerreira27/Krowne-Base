## Krowne Product Hub

This application serves as a hub for managing and displaying Krowne product information. Users can view existing products, add new ones, and potentially edit product details (depending on implementation).

## Technology Stack

*   **Next.js:** A React framework for building server-side rendered and statically generated web applications.
*   **React:** A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
*   **TypeScript:** A typed superset of JavaScript that compiles to plain JavaScript. It provides static type checking to help catch errors early.
*   **PostgreSQL:** A powerful, open-source object-relational database system used for storing product data.
*   **Cloud SQL for PostgreSQL:** Google Cloud's managed database service for PostgreSQL, used to host the product data.
*   **Firebase App Hosting:** A hosting solution optimized for Next.js applications, handling server-side rendering and static asset serving.

## Database Storage

Product data is stored in a PostgreSQL database. While the specific hosting for the PostgreSQL instance might be managed separately within Google Cloud Platform, the application interacts with it using a PostgreSQL client library to perform standard database operations (inserting, retrieving, updating, and deleting data).


## Language Usage

*   **TypeScript:** Used throughout the project for building the Next.js application, providing type safety and improved code maintainability.
*   **JavaScript:** The compiled output of TypeScript, and also used for some configuration files and potentially for specific client-side interactions where TypeScript isn't strictly necessary (though the project leans heavily on TypeScript).
*   **HTML:** The structural markup of the web pages, generated by React components.
*   **CSS:** Used for styling the application's user interface, likely utilizing a framework like Tailwind CSS as indicated by the presence of `tailwind.config.ts`.
